module Combinators.Future exposing (ckm, km, l, m, m2, u, y, θ, ω)

{-| The Crossed Konstant Mocker combinator.

Currently unable to implement due the M combinator requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `c (k m)` if that happens.

-}


ckm : Result String value
ckm =
    Result.Err "Unimplementable until the M combinator is implemented."


{-| The Konstant Mocker combinator.

Currently unable to implement due the M combinator requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `k m` if that happens.

-}
km : Result String value
km =
    Result.Err "Unimplementable until the M combinator is implemented."


{-| The L combinator.

Currently unable to implement due the M combinator requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `c b m` if that ever becomes possible.

-}
l : Result String value
l =
    Result.Err "Unimplementable until the M combinator is implemented."


{-| The M combinator.

Currently unable to implement due to requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `s i i` if that ever becomes possible.

-}
m : Result String value
m =
    Result.Err "Unimplemented currently."


{-| The M2 combinator.

Currently unable to implement due the M combinator requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `b m` if that happens.

-}
m2 : Result String value

u =
    Result.Err "Unimplementable until the M combinator is implemented."


{-| The Y combinator.

Currently unable to implement due the M combinator requiring infinite type recursion.

Implementable as `s l l` if that happens.

-}
y : Result String value
y =
    Result.Err "Unimplementable until the M combinator is implemented."
